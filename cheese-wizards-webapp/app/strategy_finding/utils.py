"""
This is the scaffolding for the algorithms which will eventurally
be used to find a player's path to the big cheeze

The idea so far:
 - The player choses a 'goal' power level
 - The player choses from a limited set of filters:
      {
          duel: Bool
          transfer: Bool
          ascend: Bool
      }
 - The algorithm percribes _a_ path to that power level
    (not necesarily the best way to get there)

The output for the front-end would have to be in a text box
